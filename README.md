Recently my colleagues and I were reached out by a multinational company, 'Microsoft" to determine an ideal formula to make a successful movie.


Based on our Analysis our recommendation would be:
1) Prefer the create a movie with a major theame to be arround following genres:
    - Animation
    - Action
    - Adventure
    - Family
    - Fantasy
    - Sci-Fi
    
2) Create a bigger budget fill with a big marketing budget. 
    - Ideas is to reach as many people as possible
   
3) Produce at least 3-4 movies per year to start with. 



# Project Summary

Before diving into any great project, we conducted our analysis on market and the company:

Deliverables: 

Analysis on available movie data extrapolating on multiple factors and trends to create a detailed report and our recommendations for a new production of film


We assumed certain things about the company:

1) The production budget has no limit.
2) They want to reach-out to masses
3) Make profit


We divided our project into 3 segments:

1) Data Gathering and Research
2) Data cleaning and Feature Engineering
3) Analysis and Visualization 

# 1) Data Gathering and research

There was a lot of back and forth from research and data gathering. Research would shed light on what type of data is required or can be used for our analysis. And data gathering would be tedious work with a lot of blanks or mismatched data. 

All the data gathered or generated can be found under the Data folder.  

The following zipped files obtained or downloaded from IMDB's public datasets:https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/ are under Data/zippedfiles
1) title.akas.tsv.gz – Contains information for titles:
2) title.basics.tsv – Contains information for titles:
3) title.crew.tsv.gz – Contains the director and writer information for all the titles in IMDb.
4) title.principals.tsv.gz – Contains the principal cast/crew for titles
5) title.ratings.tsv.gz – Contains the IMDb rating and votes information for titles
6) name.basics.tsv.gz – Contains the information for crew members' names
7) bom.movie_gross.csv – 
8) tmdb.movies.csv –
9) rt.movie_info.tsv –
10) rt.reviews.tsv –
11) tmdb.movies.csv –
12) tn.movie_budgets.csv –

Following files were generated by scraping:
1) movieMoney.csv: Scrapped budget from [The-numbers website](www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets/all)

```python

    #Takes in the URL as an argument, and returns the chart that the movies are in.

    def html_parse(url):
        html_page = requests.get(url, timeout=5)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(html_page.content, 'html.parser')
        chart = soup.find(id = 'page_filling_chart')
        movie_container = chart.findAll('tr') #grabs all movie entries on the page and puts into a list
        return movie_container

#Takes in the row containing the movie title, profits, release date, and costs and returns a list of #those.
    def movie_extract(data_container):
            release_date = data_container[1].text #release date
            movie_name = data_container[2].text #name of movie
            prod_budget = data_container[3].get_text(strip=True) #production budget
            gross_dom = data_container[4].get_text(strip=True) #gross domestic 
            gross_world = data_container[5].get_text(strip=True) #gross worldwide

            return [release_date, movie_name, prod_budget, gross_dom, gross_world]
```


2) Movie_budget.csv: Scrapped movie production houses combined with other IMDB files. 

```python

    def scrape_imdb(searchThis, company):
        ''' Scrape IMDB Title search result pages for movies and Gross Revenue($) by paticular Company '''

        base_url = 'https://www.imdb.com'

        search_criteria = searchThis
        actualURL = base_url + search_criteria
        time.sleep(5) # Times was added to avoid getting locked out
        html = requests.get(actualURL)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(html.content, 'html.parser')
        movieName = []
        grossList = []
        n = 1 # Starting for while loop
        page_companydf = pd.DataFrame(columns= ['Title', 'Gross'])
        text = soup.find('div', class_= 'desc').find('span').text.split()[-2]
        number = int(text.replace(',', '')) # Search for the number of search titles
        print(number) # Print for confirmation
        while n < round(((number+50)/50)):
            movie_Dlist = soup.find('div', class_= 'lister-list')
            movieName = get_name(movie_Dlist)
            grossList = get_gross(movie_Dlist)

            df = pd.DataFrame([movieName, grossList]).transpose()
            df.columns = ['Title', 'Gross']
            page_companydf = page_companydf.append(df)

            if soup.find('div', class_= 'desc').find_all('a')[-1].text == 'Next »': # Searches for next page
                search_criteria = soup.find('div', class_= 'desc').find_all('a')[-1]['href']
                n += 1
                actualURL = base_url + search_criteria
                html = requests.get(actualURL)
                soup = BeautifulSoup(html.content, 'html.parser')
                if (n % 10) == 0:
                    print(actualURL)

                time.sleep(5)
            else:
                break
            page_companydf['Company'] = company
        return page_companydf

```


Some articles Referenced for our research were:

# 2) Data cleaning and Feature Engineering

After all the research and data gathering, our next step was to understand the type of data we have and what kind of new features we can generate. 

First step was to combine all the fragmented data and turn them into usable fields. Mostly all the data was in a string format. So we converted all the dollar values($) into `float` data type and all the dates and years were converted to `datetime` data type. 

From our research we realized that due to production accounting methods most of the movies don't make profit on paper. As per stephenfollows.com market budget (not included) could be as much as production budget. However, revenue generation for movies can continue after a movie has stopped showing in theaters. So to keep it simple we only used profit generated as a ratio based on production cost and Global/Domestic/Worldwide revenues. 


### Feature Engineering

To account for inflation (at rate of 3.22% as per [inflationdata.com](https://inflationdata.com/Inflation/Inflation_Rate/Long_Term_Inflation.asp)). We adjusted our dollar values based on the movie release year. 

```python
df[Col_name] = df[Col_name] * (2020 - df['year'])*1.0322
    
```

Also to analyse based on seasons we created a column for 'Seasons' based on release month and following key:


```python
    season_dict = {1.0 : 'Winter', 2.0 : 'Winter' , 3.0 : 'Spring',
              4.0 : 'Spring', 5.0 : 'Spring', 6.0 : 'Summer',
              7.0 : 'Summer', 8.0 : 'Summer', 9.0 : 'Fall',
              10.0 : 'Fall', 11.0 : 'Fall', 12.0 : 'Winter',
              'NaN' : 'NaN'}
```
We combined required data into one master file Final_Movie_Budget.csv. We have data points on about 6K movies.


# 3) Analysis and Visualizations


Based on our research we decided to focus our analysis on the following 3 main topics. 

1) How movie genre affects profit:
    a) We will also analyse which season a particular genre can be released
2) How production cost and the Rating/popularity affects profits
    a) See if number of views is what matters
    b) See if higher production costs get more views
3) How does the number of movies created by a studio affect the average profit


### Analysis 1) Profit vs Genres

For this analysis, we ensure that each of its genres is represented in the dataset by splitting the genres into individual rows.  

![Profit VS Genres](/Images/Genre_vs_profit.png)

Further we compared the AVG Production Budget VS AVG Gross Revenue per Genre to analyze which genre on average more profit. 

![Genre_budget_vs_profit](/Images/Genre_budget_vs_profit.png)

Genres such as Animation and Adventure on average generated more profit. Next best would be Action, Family, Fantasy & Sci-Fi. 
Quick note that News genres were the best in class profit to production budget ratio. 

By a quick look at the first graph we can tell that Animation is really the only genre here that seems to have over 75% of its representatives being profitable.



On further breaking down the data into seasonal releases

![Genre_Season_vs_profit](/Images/Genre_Season_vs_profit.png)

There is no particular trend. We broke it down further into months: 


![Genre_Month_vs_profit](/Images/Genre_Month_vs_profit.png)

And we see that releasing the movies during summer holidays (May, June, July and August) will be a good bet for many genres specially, animation, action, adventure, Sci-Fi. Also War movies seem to do exceptionally well in July and December, and history movies seem to do well in May.


### Analysis 2) Ratings VS Profit

Does the movie rating matters? Does number of votes correlates with profit?

![NumVotes_vs_profit](/Images/NumVotes_vs_profit.png)

From the chart there is a correlation between the number of votes and profit. 

Upon further analysis we found that:
**95% of movies have less than : 419987.60 votes**
**95% of movies have less than : $4,696,599,222.13 profit**
**5% of movies have less than : -$341,045,397.31 profit**
**95% of movies have less than : $1,703,130,000.0 production budget**

The industry rule of thumb as per [stephenfollows.com](https://stephenfollows.com/how-movies-make-money-hollywood-blockbusters/) is that marketing budget equal to production budget. Therefore, we compared production budget with number of votes

![budget_vs_votes](/Images/budget_vs_votes.png)

The positive correlation observed can be linked to a big market budget for big budget movies.

However, where we see a definite positive correlation is with production budget.

![budget_vs_profit](/Images/budget_vs_profit.png)

Where we don't see any relation is between user rating and production budget

![budget_vs_rating](/Images/budget_vs_rating.png)

Hence from the analysis it is clear that we want to aim for a higher number of votes. Which can be achieved with increased marketing/production budget. 


### Analysis 3) Studio production 

As said by [Steve Job](https://filmtrooper.com/129-movies-make-money/) while being the head of Pixar, everyone will fail sometimes. Hence, a good bet will be to increase the number of movie productions to offset the failures. 

![numMovies_vs_profit](/Images/numMovies_vs_profit.png)

As the number of movie releases in a year increases for a studio, the profitability of that studio seems to increase. This could be explained by a few reasons, one of which being: Studios that create profitable movies tend to produce more movies in a year.



# Conclusion

After analysing the data from different perspectives, we can safely convey our analysis and recommendation to our client. Despite the fact that many movies don't see returns on their investments, movie making can be a lucrative industry with the right factors. 

A) We recommend that central plot or style of the movies should be around following few genres:

    1) Animation
    2) Action
    3) Adventure
    **Sub Geners could be**
    - Family
    - Sci-Fi
    - Fantasy

B) To see most return on investment we should plan to release those movies around summer (May-Jul). Due to summer holidays more audience will be available to spend an eveving for a good affordable entertainment

c) We should focus our marketing to reach as many audiences as possible. Meaning reaching users on multiple platforms to inform about our new mega movie which requires a big budget. 

d) Release about 3-4 0.5 - 1.0 billion budget movies a year for a steady net profits. It would avoid any bad year due to single mega movie flop.







### Future Analysis

1) Does opening week fan rating increase revenue?
2) Relate number of region the movie was released in with international market cut
3) International market appeal. Which genres succeed worldwide?
4) Explore the individuals responsible for making profitable movies
    - Actors, writers, and directors
    - Sub categorize them by each genre
5) Finally, what combinations of genres do well?
    - What combinations do better than their individual parts?
